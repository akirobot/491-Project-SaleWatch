Here are some basic instructions to connect to the server using PuTTY, if you have a similar SSH client, then the steps are most likely the same:
  1. Download the .pem
  2. Convert the private key into a .ppk using PuTTYgen
  3. In the host name enter this: ec2-54-183-132-211.us-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com
    - If you entered this as the host name, follow the rest of the steps and it still doesn't connect, then message me
    - If the server is shut down then restarted, it changes the name, every time
  4. Under Connection -> SSH -> Auth enter the location of the .ppk file
  5. Don't change any of the default settings
  6. Press Open
  7. PuTTY might say that the key isn't stored or something, just ignore it and press yes
  8. Log in as bitnami
  9. You are now connected to the server!
    - If you got to this point and somehow still can't connect to the server, let me know
    - The MEAN stack is installed by default, so you should just be able to load files using it and it should work
    - At the current moment (2/6/19) the server is not set up for FTP file transfer
    - I don't think you can direct clone the files either, as the repo is private, FTP should be the work around
    
Ignore the MongoDB password for now, I haven't set it up completely yet
